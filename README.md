## **Built With**

ResQCode is built using modern technologies and tools to ensure a robust, scalable, and user-friendly disaster management platform:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org):** A React-based framework for building fast and scalable web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to improve code quality and developer experience.
- **[Geist](https://vercel.com/font):** A modern font family used for a clean and readable design, integrated using Next.js's font optimization feature (`next/font`).
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/):** The deployment platform that enables seamless integration with Next.js and provides performance optimizations for production-ready applications.
